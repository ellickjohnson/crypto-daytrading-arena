"""Deploy a single named AgentRouterNode for the daytrading arena.

Each router subscribes to the shared ``agent_router.input`` topic with its
own consumer group, so every agent receives every market tick independently.
The ``--chat-node-name`` flag targets a specific named ChatNode for LLM
inference.

Example:
    uv run python deploy_router_node.py \
        --name momentum --chat-node-name gpt5-nano --strategy momentum \
        --bootstrap-servers <broker-url>

    uv run python deploy_router_node.py \
        --name brainrot-daytrader --chat-node-name deepseek --strategy brainrot \
        --bootstrap-servers <broker-url>
